#Big Dream Farm

This is a team project for a JavaScript class. It started with a student's website created for a class prior and the JS was added to make the site responsive. There were three people working on this project. 

I contributed in several smaller ways that were not documented completely. The biggest parts of the project I worked on were:

         -calendar 

         -photo array
